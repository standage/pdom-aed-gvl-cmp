Using this procedure to examine the quality (as measured by Maker and GAEVAL)
of several whole-genome annotations for Polistes dominula. Executing

  ./build.sh

on a UNIX system will create two tab-delimited data files containing Maker and
GAEVAL quality scores and produce several visualizations of the distrutions of
these scores. The data files produced by the build procedure can easily be
examined in more detail with standard visualization and analysis tools available
in (for example) R or Python.
